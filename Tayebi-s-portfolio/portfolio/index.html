Hi there, my name is Tayebi Pranta, and my journey began in Bangladesh, where I was born before my family and I moved to America when I was around three years old. This move was 
a result of my mom's incredible luck in winning a lottery, an event that opened up a world of opportunities for us. I often reflect on how grateful I am for my family's support, 
particularly my mom, whose determination and good fortune have allowed me to explore opportunities that might have otherwise been out of reach.

I have a strong interest in sports, particularly volleyball and soccer, which have played a significant role in my life by teaching me the value of teamwork, perseverance, and 
dedication. However, my true passion lies in the world of coding and technology, a passion that was sparked during my time in middle school. It was during the pandemic that I 
first dipped my toes into the world of coding, starting with a programming language called Scratch. Even though Scratch was just the beginning, it ignited a curiosity in me to 
learn more and delve deeper into the vast world of programming languages.

Using Scratch, I created platformer games, and while I didn't yet know the major programming languages, I knew that I was only scratching the surface of what I could achieve. 
This early experience set the stage for my journey into more complex coding, and I am now eagerly exploring and mastering new languages.

Looking to the future, I aspire to become a software engineer, where I can contribute to major projects for big companies while also working on side projects, particularly in 
game development. The world of coding is vast and ever-evolving, and I am excited to continue learning, growing, and making my mark in this dynamic field.
